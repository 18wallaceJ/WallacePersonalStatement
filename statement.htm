Personal Statement<br>
Joshua David Wallace<br>
24/08/2007<br>
St Helena School<br>
<br>
As the youngest child, I was always competitive. Striving to do my best at everything, I strongly believe this led me to becoming who I am today.<br>
I started primary school at Colchester High School until year 6, where I developed an interest for reading, history and science that followed me to secondary school. 
At St Helena School, I have improved my reading, broadened my knowledge of the humanities and found my element – science and I truly believe that the school helped cultivate this passion through their STEM clubs. 
Over the years I attended Drone Club, where my team entered the Raytheon Quadcopter Challenge 2018-19 where we reached the nationals; which I believe to be my greatest achievement. 
I also attended rocketry; VEX club – a robotics competition – for two seasons where my team, a school mate and I, reached the 2020-21 nationals, another great achievement; and Arduino club where we designed, built and programmed our own projects. 
Both VEX and Arduino club gave me an understanding of the engineering process and helped me learn C++. 
I am taking 11 GCSEs which are a combination of what I love and what I have to do – I wouldn’t describe myself as an innately creative person – I improve through countless revisions but this means I struggle with English, a surprise to many people who know how much I love to read; I’ve already sat my English Literature and attained a grade 6. 
On the other hand, I think I am a logically thinking person – which helps me with maths, the sciences and the humanities, probably a reason as to why I enjoy them so much. 
I have been attending Further Maths masterclasses and am hoping to sit the exams in the summer (I have included this as part of my 11 GCSEs though I haven’t received a predicted grade yet as I haven’t yet sat any exams for this subject).<br>
I strongly believe that I developed all of my hobbies through my love for reading. 
The first book that I can remember was ‘Beast Quest: Nanook’ by Adam Blade. 
I, in year 3 at the time, was enchanted by the young hero and his companions who went around fighting an evil wizard, and I remember coming home with fourteen of the series from the library each month until I had read every single title of the series. 
I started to venture out into different genres and read the ‘Percy Jackson’ series by Rick Riordan, which started my love for Greek and Roman mythology and soon after, culture. 
I read a book on the second world war, with an A3 spread on the Manhattan project featuring an image of a nuclear weapon, starting my fascination for warfare and physics. 
A book on space created an interest in stars and black holes and the secrets of the universe. 
Two books written by Randall Munroe, ‘How to’ and ‘What if?’ lead to a passion for engineering and maths – even though each idea in the books was completely ridiculous. 
I bought a book called ‘Quantum physics in minutes’ by Gemma Lavender, which was too advanced at the time, but I still follow the progress of Sycamore – Google’s quantum computer – and advancements in the progression of understanding around quantum entanglement and dark energy. 
Recently, I read a historical fiction series by Simon Scarrow which follows two Roman soldiers in the first century.<br>
Other hobbies I have include photography – I enjoy photographing birds, insects and foxes – and large scale projects. 
For example, I am responsible for my church's audio setup, I fix problems, research better ways of doing things, monitor levels and adjust equalisers during services. 
I’ve also built my own computer which I am able to use for coding projects and image editing software, a large undertaking that took lots of research into cost-effectiveness of components, software compatibility and patience while assembling.<br>
These hobbies come through with my ideas for the future. 
My dream job would be a nature videographer and cinematic drone pilot, combining my love of nature photography with my love of technology. 
I first found out about the job when watching the end of ‘Blue Planet II’ when they were showing how the program was filmed. 
However, this is a very niche job which requires an immense skill set and while important to have dreams I am also working towards other careers. 
The most promising of which would be an aerospace engineer, again a job that fits in well with my interests, or going into pathogenic studies, depending on how I feel while doing my A levels. 
So, while I have a few ideas I am keeping my options open so that I can change direction, rather than burning bridges early on.<br>
I have achieved  high levels of progression in a couple of competitions run by VEX and Raytheon, where my team won the heats and officially came forth in the country. 
Each team was given a country to build a drone for, my team was awarded Japan. 
My interest in nuclear energy helped as we decided to build a geiger counter in Arduino club and attached it to the drone so it could survey the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear disaster site for dangerously high levels of radiation. 
I was the repair mechanic and we had a pilot, backup pilot, designer and a chief mechanic. 
It was the most fun I’ve ever had. 
However, I tend to view my progress as a reminder of how far I have left to go. 
This mentality is far from ideal, though it does motivate me to do better for the next time. 
Instead, I tend to take victory from iterative improvement, rather than the end result.<br>
